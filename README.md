I bought call of duty for the first time in years because I was stuck inside due to the pandemic lockdowns and started playing the zombies outbreak mode.
Outbreak, at the time, had a limited number of maps and a limited number of modes.
Upon joining a game, the mode and map that you played first was random, but they always rotated to the same mode and map respectively.
Given this information, I wrote a quick program in C to predict what mode and map was next.
I chose C because I hadn't written anything in C in a while. Python would've been more appropriate for something like this.
